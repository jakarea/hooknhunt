Please read the attached AI_CONTEXT.md file (v1.3). We will now finalize the Supplier CRUD UI. This involves two tasks.

Task 1: Update src/stores/supplierStore.ts

Update the supplierStore.ts file to add the deleteSupplier action.

Requirement:

Add a new action: deleteSupplier(id: number) => Promise<void>.

This function must call the API: DELETE /api/v1/admin/suppliers/{id}.

On success, it must filter the deleted supplier from the suppliers array in the state (no re-fetch).

It must re-throw any API errors.

Provide only the complete, updated code for the src/stores/supplierStore.ts file. (It should now have fetchSuppliers, addSupplier, updateSupplier, and deleteSupplier).
