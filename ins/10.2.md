Please read the attached AI_CONTEXT.md file. We need to build the UI to link Suppliers to a Product with multiple URLs.

Task 1: Update src/stores/productStore.ts

Update the productStore to handle attaching/detaching suppliers.

Add actions:

attachSupplier: (productId: number, supplierId: number, urls: string[]) => Promise<void>

API Call: POST /api/v1/admin/products/{productId}/suppliers

Body: { supplier_id: supplierId, supplier_product_urls: urls }

detachSupplier: (productId: number, supplierId: number) => Promise<void>

API Call: DELETE /api/v1/admin/products/{productId}/suppliers/{supplierId}

Task 2: Create src/components/forms/product/ProductSuppliersTab.tsx

Create a new component that manages the suppliers for a specific product.

Requirements:

Props: productId: number, currentSuppliers: Supplier[] (The suppliers already attached to this product).

State:

selectedSupplierId: string (for the dropdown).

urls: string[] (Array of URL strings, default to ['']).

UI Sections:

Top Section (Add New):

Combobox/Select: To choose a supplier from the full list of suppliers (Fetch all suppliers using useSupplierStore on mount).

Dynamic Inputs: A list of Input fields for URLs.

Buttons: "Add another URL" (adds empty string to urls array), "Remove" (removes URL input).

Main Button: "Attach Supplier" (Calls attachSupplier).

Bottom Section (List):

A simple table or list showing currentSuppliers.

Display the Supplier Name and a list of their Links (clickable).

"Detach/Remove" button for each supplier (Calls detachSupplier).

Tech Stack: React, Shadcn (Select, Button, Input, Table, Label), Lucide Icons (Plus, Trash).

Provide the code for:

Updated productStore.ts
