Please read the attached AI_CONTEXT.md file (v1.3). We will now finalize the Suppliers.tsx page by adding the Add/Edit modal and Delete confirmation.

Task: Update the src/pages/purchase/Suppliers.tsx file (created in Step 9.2).

Requirements:

Imports: Import useState, Supplier (type), SupplierForm (component), useSupplierStore, useAuthStore, RoleGuard, Dialog (and its parts), AlertDialog (and its parts), DropdownMenu (and its parts), Button, MoreHorizontal (icon), and toast.

State:

Get suppliers, isLoading, fetchSuppliers, deleteSupplier from useSupplierStore.

Get user from useAuthStore.

Create local state: isModalOpen: boolean (for Add/Edit) and isAlertOpen: boolean (for Delete).

Create local state: editingSupplier: Supplier | null and deletingSupplierId: number | null.

Handlers:

Create handleOpenModal(supplier: Supplier | null): sets editingSupplier and isModalOpen = true.

Create handleCloseModal(): sets editingSupplier = null and isModalOpen = false.

Create openDeleteConfirm(id: number): sets deletingSupplierId and isAlertOpen = true.

Create handleConfirmDelete():

Calls deleteSupplier(deletingSupplierId).

Shows a toast on success or error.

Closes the AlertDialog.

JSX (Header):

The "Add New Supplier" button should call handleOpenModal(null).

JSX (Add/Edit Modal):

Add a <Dialog> component.

Set its open state to isModalOpen.

Inside <DialogContent>, render the <SupplierForm /> component.

Pass the required props: initialData={editingSupplier} and onClose={handleCloseModal}.

JSX (Delete Alert):

Add an <AlertDialog> component.

Set its open state to isAlertOpen.

Inside, add <AlertDialogHeader> ("Are you sure?") and <AlertDialogFooter>.

The "Delete" action button (<AlertDialogAction>) must call handleConfirmDelete().

JSX (Table Actions Column):

Inside the table's map function, find the "Actions" <TableCell>.

Add a <DropdownMenu> with a <MoreHorizontal> icon.

Add a <DropdownMenuItem> for "Edit" that calls handleOpenModal(supplier).

Add a (red-colored) <DropdownMenuItem> for "Delete" that calls openDeleteConfirm(supplier.id).
